# Gongren

A simple tool to manage a co-working space. This tool was developed for EspaceCO, a co-working space in Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.

# Features

* Invoicing and payment management are managed through Freshbooks: you will need an account at Freshbooks to use Gongren;
* Everything is represented as a "resource": a conference room, a projector, a desk, etc.;
* All resources know when they are busy of free;
* Fully l10ned and i18ned (French and English to start, others to come);
* more coming later!
